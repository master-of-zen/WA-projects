this data that in current state support companies and frontline battalionss have large amount of manpower and equipment, with near 0 HP stat to represent it as a part of the division, which leads to situation where support companies (later on some frontline battalions) make division more fragile, and by a lot than without them.\n","\n","### Divisions\n","In this example so far I have used GER

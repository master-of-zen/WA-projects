case by infantry battalions, so in order to have a division that is strong enough to see combat and don't have enourmous casualties in manpower and equipment it's highly rewarding to have as many of them as possible to offset no HP. \n","Which leads to any division width below 30 with support companies being a lot weaker, or smaller divisions to have less of them, probably even bare minimum of couple of them.\n","\n","Fixed size support companies provide divisions with large amount of menpower at around 25-35% with near zero HP increase.\n","\n","## Optimal division\n","\n","As WA stands currently, best strength gained is from infantry, moto, mech, and mechanized divisions being extremely resilent to damage in comparison to any other type of division, and being able to use that HP pool to compensate for filling all support company slots.\n","\n","## Abnormal casualties for high cost/ high investment divisions\n","\n","High cost divisions as Armor divisions for each country,
